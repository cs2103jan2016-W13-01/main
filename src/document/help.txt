Command: add
Adds a new task. Tasks can belong to 4 types: deadline, session, float and recurring tasks

Format for float:
>> add [title]

Format for deadline:
>> add [title] [time][date in MM/dd/yyyy]

Hint:
- deadline can also refer to tasks you want to do at a moment but has no end time
- date can also be "tomorrow", "next tuesday", "tmr". If date is empty, it is treated as today

Format for session:
>> add [title] from [start time][date] to [end time][date]
Example:

- the template "from...to..." can be shortened to "...to..." or "... - ..."
- "add Meeting with project team tmr 2pm-4pm will" means the start and end dates are the same
